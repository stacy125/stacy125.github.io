<h3>Why I Love Puerto Rico</h3>

<p class="pr">The weather is perfect even when it rains. My viewpoint on that is all of life is being hydrated! When I travel through Puerto Rico, I feel like I am traveling through one of God's perfect artistic creations. From the beaches to the waterfalls and even the mountains I feel blessed.</p>

<p class="story">I have lived in Puerto Rico on and off since 2005. Now being here a straight 5 years. The people are absolutely amazing.  During the storm of hurricane Maria, one of my gracious neighbors invited me to weather the storm in their home.  They knew I would loose my house in the storm.  Together we watched as the winds tore apart my house like in the movie "The Wizard of Oz".  We watched their tree battle to keep it's roots in the ground. You might think me crazy but I was amazed watching the storm.  It was sad though the after effects. So many unnecessay loss of homes and lives. The positive side was witnessing everyone joining together to help each other out and clean up beautiful Puerto Rico.  Outside help was limited and it took a long while before Puerto Rico and all the people here received it. After moving into my new home I was greeted by my spectacular neighbors.  There was no water, electricity and even cell service was limited.  They brought me food and water.  I got to witness actual families that loved each other, supported each other and had fun together. Neighbors that helped neighbors. I consistently was greeted with such warm passion at my home and when traveling through. The children here are all so precious, smart, polite and a joy to spend time with. I have a service dog named, Ziva.  She plays soccer really well. When we would go out the children would love to play soccer with us. I felt so much joy and blessed when this would occur. Do to some unfortunate events I had to move again.  This time into the mountains.  I live in home that seats on 22 acres.  It has a river with 3 waterfalls.  There are so many different types of fruits and vegetables. I live here with 5 dogs, 2 cats and 11 chickens. The people in this town are truly a blessing.  The neighbors here help each other out. They are all warm and friendly. Even though the houses are far apart they stop by and check on me. This turned out to be a blessing.  Last year I fell down the mountain breaking my ankle and foot. This wonderful angel, my neighbor, came to my rescue. She brought me food everyday. She took me to the doctors and hospitals. She even came with the mayor and his driver to see how they could help because I didn't have insurance. In the end thanks to everyone I am ok.  More than okay. I am blessed. Not just from Puerto Rico and all that it gives freely but the magnificent people that I have had the pleasure of knowing. Even the police officers in this town are awesome.</p>
        
<h1>My Business Experience</h1>

<div><img class="hand" src="hands.png" alt=""></div>

<p class="work">At the age of 12 years old I was blessed to be hired as a real estate secretary at one of my neighbor's real estate office. He taught me everything about real estate, advertising and what it took to have a successful business. I worked there until I was 18 years old. From there I became a paralegal. Started working for a major law firm NYC. Then worked for law firms in NJ specializing in Real Estate and family law until I was 25 years old. I then worked about a year and half selling cars. I had started studying consistently natural medicine at the age of 10 years old. At 27 years old I was blessed to meet this wonderful woman who was a Ayurvedic physcian/surgeon. She was teaching a ayurvedic class that I attend.  She saw something special in me and graciously offered a one on one internship with her that lasted for 5 years. During this time, after leaving sales, I had opened a Natural Medicine practice. Here I offered spiritual coaching, nutritional coaching and massage therapy.  Through this business not only was I blessed to heal so many but through this process I gained so much more knowledge. I am now ready and excited for my journey into the software engineering experience.  </p>
