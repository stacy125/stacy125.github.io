        <div><img class="hand" src="hands.png" alt=""></div>
        <div class="info">
            <p class="work">At the age of 12 years old I was blessed to be hired as a real estate secretary at one of my
                neighbor's real estate office. He taught me everything about real estate, advertising and what it took
                to have a successful business. I worked there until I was 18 years old. From there I became a paralegal.
                Started working for a major law firm NYC. Then worked for law firms in NJ specializing in Real Estate
                and family law until I was 25 years old. I then worked about a year and half selling cars. I had started
                studying consistently natural medicine at the age of 10 years old. At 27 years old I was blessed to meet
                this wonderful woman who was a Ayurvedic physcian/surgeon. She was teaching a ayurvedic class that I
                attend. She saw something special in me and graciously offered a one on one internship with her that
                lasted for 5 years. During this time, after leaving sales, I had opened a Natural Medicine practice.
                Here I offered spiritual coaching, nutritional coaching and massage therapy. Through this business not
                only was I blessed to heal so many but through this process I gained so much more knowledge. I am now
                ready and excited for my journey into the software engineering experience. </p>
